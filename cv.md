## About myself:
Having started my career as a design engineer with high skills in 3D building design. I worked in different programs: Revit, ArchiCAD,
AutoCAD, Civil Engineering, FlowDesign, Lumion6.0, RobotConstruction and much others

Five years ago I’ve become SMM specialist. I’ve mastered different Instagram and other platforms account with large number of subscribers (about 5 million),
learned how to work with SMM marketing, become an advanced Admin and work on myself all this time. I really love Social Media. I have TikTok expert account with 250,000 followers https://www.tiktok.com/@maru_koach?lang=ru-RU

When I have hard skills in SMM this gives me extra free time, which I spend learning Frontend Development.
I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for my future growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.
